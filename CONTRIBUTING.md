> Due to project's scope, pull requests directly to the main branch are accepted.

### Contributing to Templates

To add a new template, first ensure that the template you are submitting is different from the ones that already exist. Then, add a `.md` file and a screenshot of the template's top-most section to the `public/screenshots` directory.

- Ensure that the screenshot and the markdown file have the same name.

- Do not customize the `templates.json` manually; it is generated during build time.

- Only `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.jfif` image extensions are accepted.

- Before creating a pull request, build the project locally to receive informative errors in case of violations.

### Bug Fixes and Feature Requests

In case of bug fixes or feature requests, open an issue and ensure it is descriptive enough. Describe the problem or the requested feature thoroughly. If your issue is accepted and deemed valid, you can open a pull request with the fixed code.

- Recreate the problem and describe the steps.

- Provide images if possible.
